Hello! My name is Marina. I grew up in Stellenbosch, a student town in South Africa that is surrounded by mountains and never-ending vineyards. Growing up I loved drawing and painting (basically anything that allowed me to put some colour on a piece of paper!). So of course, I went and did the most logical thing ever. . . I decided to go and study mechanical engineering! Luckily, I also love maths and drawing skills can come in handy in those machine design classes.
Engineering is great fun, but every now and then I like to do some artsy stuff. And this is what this website is for. . . a collection of (mostly random) projects I do in my free time.

Where am I now? I finished my undergraduate studies in 2016 and at the moment I am living (and studying) in Leuven, a small but beautiful city in the heart of Flanders, Belgium.
