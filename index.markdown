Hi! My name is Marina. I grew up in Stellenbosch, a student town in South Africa surrounded by mountains and never-ending vineyards. Growing up I always loved drawing and painting. So of course, I went and did the most logical thing ever... I decided to study mechanical engineering :P. Luckily, I also love maths and drawing skills can sometimes come in handy in machine design classes.
Engineering is great fun, but every now and then I like to do some artsy stuff. And this is what this website is for...a collection of the projects I do in my free time!


I finished my undergraduate studies in 2016 and at the moment I am living (and studying) in Leuven, a small and beautiful city in the heart of Flanders, Belgium.
