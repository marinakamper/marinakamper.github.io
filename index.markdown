Hi! My name is Marina. Growing up I was always loved drawing and painting. So of course, I went and did the logical thing by de engineering. Luckily I also love maths and sometimes drawing skills can come in handy...
It's great but every now and then I like to do some artsy stuff.



I grew up in Stellenbosch in South Africa but at the moment I am living (and studying) in Leuven, a small student city, in the Belgium.

Here I will upload some of my projects that I do in my free time.
