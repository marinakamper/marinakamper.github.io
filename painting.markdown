Sometimes, when I am in the mood (doesn't happen too often) I do a little bit of oil painting.




<div class="container">
  <img src="/assets/paints/old_man.JPG" alt="{{ filename }}"  class="image" />
  <div class="middle">
    <div class="text">
      <p>Reference pic</p>
      <p>Medium: Oil</p>
      <p>Size: 20 by 30 cm</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
